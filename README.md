# Drowsiness-Detection
I build the model which detect the drowsiness of driver.
For training model I have used CNN architecture but this is not giving better accuracy so I decided to go with Transfer learning. I used Inseption-v3 for training. But the most challenging part is computer vision because the configuration of my machine is not that much better to perform on computer vision problems. So I reduced dataset. 
There are two parts of this project one is training of model and other is detect the face and eyes using computer vision. 
I have set the alert sound, it sounds if the driver looks drowsy for 15 seconds and turns off when the timer goes below 15.
